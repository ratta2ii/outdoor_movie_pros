                <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraph}>
                    Setup and standard delivery are included. Additional charges may apply if:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The event location is farther out (trip charge may apply).</li>
                        <li>The setup requires unusual accommodations (stairs, rooftop, etc.).</li>
                    </ul>
                    If you have a unique situation, let us know and we’ll sort it out before the event.

                    Do you deliver to other cities?
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraph}>
                    Absolutely! We can travel anywhere. Call us and we’ll create a custom quote for your
                    location.

                    Are there special licenses or permits needed for the height of the screen?
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraph}>
                    Generally no. Local requirements vary, but we have never seen a permit required for
                    screens up to 24’. Permits and engineering documents are usually only needed for very
                    large screens in stricter states like California.
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="h2" className={classes.subheading}>
                    Does the standard 2.5 hour rental time include your setup time?
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraph}>
                    No. Setup and breakdown are on us. The 2.5 hours begins once the setup is complete, at
                    the agreed-upon start time.
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="h2" className={classes.subheading}>
                    Does it have to be dark to see the picture?
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraph}>
                    Yes. Outdoor projection works like a movie theater, except the “lights out” is sunset.
                    To know when you can start, check{" "}

                        local sunset times here

                <Typography variant="h2" className={classes.subheading}>
                    When setting up the screen, does sunset direction affect placement?
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraph}>
                    Yes. If the audience faces west (and the screen faces east), you can usually start the
                    movie earlier. Direct sunlight on the screen delays the start by about 15 minutes
                    because the reflective surface amplifies the brightness.

                    How much drop-off is there using rear projection versus front projection?
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraph}>
                    Light loss is minimal—about 10%. Both methods have advantages:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Front projection:</strong> Brighter image, requires projector in front of
                            audience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rear projection:</strong> Cleaner setup with equipment behind the screen,
                            but slightly dimmer.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    The right choice depends on your event layout.
                </Typography>

                    What about wind and wind rating?

                <Typography variant="body1" className={classes.paragraph}>
                    Safety first:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not use screens in winds exceeding 15 mph.</li>
                        <li>Use extreme caution with approaching storms or high winds.</li>
                        <li>Lower the screen immediately if severe weather appears on radar.</li>
                    </ul>
                    A conservative approach ensures the safety of both your audience and equipment.
